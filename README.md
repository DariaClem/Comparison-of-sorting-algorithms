# Comparison of sorting algorithms

_Proiect1_SD_ is a PowerPoint were I compared 5 sorting algorithms based on their time complexity. For every tipe of input I made a BEST/WORST top. The file input I used is _date.in_. A side conclusion of this project is that Radix Sort is faster than Quick Sort in 85% cases. In the other 15% cases the time difference is very small.  

The sorting algorithms are:
1. Radix Sort
2. Merge Sort
3. Shell Sort
4. Counting Sort
5. Quick Sort
